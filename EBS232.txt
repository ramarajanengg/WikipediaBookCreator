* Scenario 1) New account product > A/R enters PO number at account product level > CVP creates a resource for account product > Customer wants to remove all PO numbers
* Scenario 1 Issue) A/R rep is unable to delete PO number at account product level since a resource has been assigned to account product
* 
* Scenario 2) There are 5 resources that bill under one account product > 2 out of the 5 resources have special pricing which means a resource is assigned to the account product > PO number is uploaded via WebADI template and assigned at the resource level for the 2 that have special pricing > Monthly invoice is created with activity for all 5 resources

* Scenario 2 Issue: There will be 2 invoices generated...one that includes the 2 resources with special pricing and PO number assigned and a 2nd invoice with no PO number which will include the other 3 resources that do not have resources assigned to the account product (the logic is looking at the account product PO field which is blank)
* 


* Scenario 3) Account product has PO number assigned at the resource level, but all resources are expired.
* Scenario 3 Issue: Users can not modify PO number at account product level for those resources that are active and use the standard price
